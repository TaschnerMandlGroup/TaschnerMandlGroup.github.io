## Hello World, Iâ€™m Simon! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my digital abode! Iâ€™m navigating the fascinating crossroads of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and medicine, currently deciphering the secrets of cell types and tumor images as a Ph.D. student in Vienna. My days are filled with exploration and discovery!

Iâ€™ve embarked on this journey with a profound passion for the transformative power of AI in healthcare. Whether itâ€™s delving into the details of MRI, CT scans, or the intricate world of biological imaging like IMC, FISH, and IF, Iâ€™m all in! My mission is to harness the potential of AI to bring forth groundbreaking advancements in medical diagnostics and treatment.

Education has been a thrilling ride for me! With a Masterâ€™s degree from the University of TÃ¼bingen and a Bachelorâ€™s from the University of Applied Sciences Saar, Iâ€™ve had my fair share of learning, experimenting, and creating. From developing algorithms for endoscopes to estimating radiation doses with Deep Learning, every step has been an adventure!

A significant focus of my research is the exploration of uncertainties in deep learning. This area is intriguing as it delves into the reliability and trustworthiness of AI models, which is paramount in healthcare applications. Understanding and quantifying uncertainty helps in ensuring that the AI-driven decisions we rely on are not only accurate but also dependable and robust, especially when it comes to critical healthcare decisions.

Tech wizardry and healthcare enthusiasm define my day-to-day life. Iâ€™m mixing and matching Python, PyTorch, Docker, and a dash of creativity in the Creative Cloud for some nice plots to cook up innovative solutions that bridge technology and healthcare. Itâ€™s a delightful blend of science and creativity, and Iâ€™m here for it!

Fancy a conversation about the wonders and complexities of AI, medical imaging, or just the latest in tech? Reach out on social media (/SGUTWEIN) or GitHub (/SimonBon). Iâ€™m always eager to connect, share stories, exchange ideas, and perhaps enjoy a virtual cup of coffee with new friends and fellow enthusiasts.

Looking forward to meeting you and exploring the boundless possibilities of AI and medicine together!
