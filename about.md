## About Us

The Taschner-Mandl Group at the St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute (CCRI) stands at the forefront of pediatric oncology research, specifically focusing on neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. Under the leadership of Dr. Sabine Taschner-Mandl, our group is dedicated to unraveling the complexities of neuroblastoma pathogenesis and striving for the advancement of precision medicine to improve outcomes for children afflicted with malignant tumors.

## Research Focus

### Our research endeavors are twofold:

Biology of High-Risk Neuroblastoma: We delve into the biology of high-risk neuroblastoma to understand the mechanics of this aggressive disease. Despite intense treatment protocols, survival rates for high-risk cases remain dismal. Our team utilizes cutting-edge CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, single-cell genomics, and epigenomics to identify the drivers of oncogenesis and epigenetic dependencies. We develop preclinical patient-derived models for functional assays and drug testing, aiming to enhance clinical trial designs and treatment efficacies.
Tumor Heterogeneity and Microenvironment: We investigate the heterogeneity within tumors and their interaction with various microenvironments. Our recent findings show significant genetic and expression differences between disseminated tumor cells and their primary tumors, which could lead to novel biomarkers and targeted therapies.
Translational Research

In the realm of diagnostics, our group is pioneering the development of new diagnostic tools and prognostic markers. We are active participants in multiple consortia, facilitating collaboration between biological researchers, computer scientists, and pediatric oncologists to refine molecular profiling techniques and liquid biopsy methodologies. Our innovative VISIOMICS software platform exemplifies our commitment to integrating complex multi-dimensional data for enhanced tumor diagnostics.

### Collaborations and Achievements

Our collaborative efforts extend to working closely with the Tumor Biology Diagnostic Team, providing ISO9001 certified diagnostic services as a national reference lab for several clinical studies. We also manage the CCRI Biobank for pediatric solid tumors in conjunction with Labdia, which is a testament to our comprehensive approach to research and patient care.

Our research is bolstered by grants from prestigious institutions such as the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) and the Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF). Our impactful work is regularly featured in top-tier scientific journals, highlighting our contributions to understanding and treating neuroblastoma.

Dr. Sabine Taschner-Mandl, a luminary in the field, not only leads our research group with distinction but also imparts her knowledge as a lecturer and a collaborator in several high-profile international projects. Her commitment to pediatric oncology research is unwavering, as evidenced by her active roles in leading international societies and initiatives aimed at enhancing cancer treatment for children.

The Taschner-Mandl Group is more than a research team; we are a beacon of hope in the quest to conquer pediatric neuroblastoma.
