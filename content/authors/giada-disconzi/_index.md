## Get to know me

**If you weren’t doing science, what would you be doing instead?**

I’m very fascinated by animation movies and the techniques that are used in the field to obtain a certain result, besides liking to draw, paint and do artsy stuff in my free time. Thus, I think I will be an animator if I wasn’t doing science.


**What completely absurd research project would you start immediately if money wasn’t an issue?**

Tattoo ink that is visible only when induced (e.g., with a specific drug). It would be absurdly cool to have ink that contains a gene that enters your cells when skin is tattooed and expresses colored and fluorescent molecules on demand, so you can decide when you want to show a tattoo or not! It would be hard to have a consistent tattoo design in time due to cell renewal, but that’s one reason why money shouldn’t be an issue for this project.


**What’s the most useless piece of knowledge you know but still want to share?**

Male platypuses have an extra claw on their rear paws that can release venom, which they use to fight other animals and among each other when in competition! :D
