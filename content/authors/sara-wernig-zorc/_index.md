## Get to know me

**If you weren’t doing science, what would you be doing instead?**

I would be a writer. I actually wrote a fictional story when I was younger, though I never showed it to anyone. I was always good at writing assays (both in Slovenian and English language) and it's something I really enjoy doing. 


**Which sci-fi movie setting would you love to become reality and why?**

Definitely Star trek! Because it represents a world of equality between different races and species and a world of scientific wonder and exploration. That kind of hopeful, collaborative world really appeals to me. 


**Which scientific tool or lab equipment would you take to a lonely island – and why?**

I’d take the Nanopore long-read sequencer (such as the MinION). That way, I could sequence all the plants and animals on the island. It would keep me busy, and I would have loads of interesting data to work on once I got back home.
