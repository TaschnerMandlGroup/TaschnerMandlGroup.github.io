## Get to know me

**If you werenâ€™t doing science, what would you be doing instead?**

I would travel the world as much as possible and do crafty things, like being a pottery artist or a tailor. I would probably want to share my ideas with others, so I would make videos about this or teach classes.


**If you could have a scientific brainstorming session with any famous person (dead or alive), who would it be?**

I would like to brainstorm with Rosalind Franklin. Her work was instrumental in the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA, and ever since I first learned about her, I was very inspired.


**What piece of lab equipment best represents your personality?**

I think a multi-channel pipette would be a good representation of my personality. It can do things efficiently and precisely, but sometimes it needs re-calibration :D As a bonus, I would add a notebook with a to-do list, as I am half a woman/half a to-do list :D
