## Get to know me

**If you weren’t doing science, what would you be doing instead?**

I’d like to try my hand at being a DJ or music producer. I’ve always loved music, and I have a habit of complaining about the DJs at bars and clubs — so trying it myself seems like an interesting alternative career path!


**What’s the weirdest or funniest thing that has ever happened to you in a lab?**

At a previous workplace, the server once overheated and triggered its emergency cooling system. Curious about the strange noises coming from the server room, we opened the door only to discover a shower of ice cubes raining down from the ceiling. Apparently, that was the system’s method of rapid cooling!


**Which scientific mystery would you love to see solved in your lifetime?**

Teleportation. How can it be done? And if I teleport somewhere, is it really me that arrives or just a clone? If so, what happened to the old me? o\_o
